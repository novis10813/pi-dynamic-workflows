 * streams, and the background-result delivery listener.

 * AgentSessionRuntime at a time; the next factory only knows process.cwd()
 * (often the launch dir), while the live manager may already be bound to the
 * session project cwd (ctx.cwd). A cwd-keyed map made those two paths miss
 * each other. One slot + post-claim project checks is the correct model.
