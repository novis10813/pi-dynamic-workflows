     *  - An entry is added when a run starts (startInBackground/runSync) or is

     *    an active RunLease.
     *  - While status is "running" or "paused", the entry is NEVER evicted —
     *    its execution could still settle (a pending executeRun() promise) or
     *    it is mid-usage-limit-checkpoint/manually-paused and still considered
     *    "the current state of this run" by callers. Eviction only ever
     *    considers an entry AFTER executeRun() has fully settled it to
     *    "completed" | "failed" | "aborted" (see IN_MEMORY_TERMINAL_STATUSES)
     *    and persisted + released its lease — i.e. strictly after the same
     *    isCurrent()-gated persistRun()/releaseRunLease() calls in
     *    executeRun()'s success/catch tails.
     *  - Once terminal, an entry becomes eviction-ELIGIBLE (recordTerminalRun())
     *    but is not necessarily evicted immediately: up to
     *    maxTerminalRunsInMemory terminal entries are kept, oldest evicted
     *    first, so a `getRun()` call immediately after completion (e.g. the
     *    "complete" event's own synchronous listeners — task-panel's result
     *    delivery, `/workflows watch`) still sees the live object. Once
     *    evicted, the entry is simply removed from `runs`; nothing else reads
     *    or writes it again.
     *  - Every caller of getRun()/getSnapshot() must treat "undefined"/null as
     *    "no live in-memory copy right now" and fall back to listRuns() (backed
     *    by run-persistence.ts, which is what's authoritative for a run once

     *    different process and only ever seen via listRuns()). resume() never
     *    depends on `runs` for a run's state either: it always reloads from
     *    persistence, so an evicted runId resumes exactly like one from a
     *    prior process.
     *  - isCurrent(managed) composes with eviction the same way it composes
     *    with resume()/deleteRun() replacing or removing an entry: eviction
     *    removes the map entry outright, so a stale execution's later settle
     *    (isCurrent() check) sees `this.runs.get(runId) !== managed` (in fact
